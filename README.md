Description
==============

This repository is a collection of tiny utility scripts, patches and hacks.
These are mostly one-time scripts, very old and very specific. I doubt you'll be able to use them as-is. Until you update and tweak them to fit your needs.

And if by chance you fix some bugs or add new features, feel free to submit a pull request. I'll be happy to merge it.
